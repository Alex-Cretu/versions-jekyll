This is the fake introduction for the install guide for a product or service. Write about new version information in this file since Git itself does the version control on this file.

The title metadata can be changed if you need to add version info to it.

The permalink metadata doesn't need to be changed because the version number will be pre-pended to it as a destination folder.

The contents of this file can change depending on which branch you use.
