This is the fake introduction for the install guide for a product or service. Write about new version information in this file since Git itself does the version control on this file.

The title metadata can be changed when you need to add version info to the permalink that is output.

The contents of this file can change depending on which branch you use.

Q: can the permalink be changed based on which branch? 
Maybe not, but found out that GitHub Pages supports a particular version of Jekyll as documented in https://pages.github.com/versions/. Currently uses Jekyll 3.4.3.
