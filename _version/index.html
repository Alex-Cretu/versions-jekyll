This page is the landing page for the root index.html.

`site.version` is: {{ site.version }}

You'd need to add links here as you add releases, and also add the `vernumber/index.html` landing pages as you add releases.

[example.com/4.1]({{base_path}}/4.1/}})
[example.com/4.1.1]({{base_path}}/4.1.1/}})
